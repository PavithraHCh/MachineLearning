    "**Observations:**\n",
    "1. Centroid-based algorithm k-Means was used for clustering for the given dataset.\n",
    "2. Instead of using all the original dimensions given in the dataset, dimensionality reduction was applied using algorithm PCA to extract principal components that can explain 99% of the variance of the dataset.\n",
    "3. As the dataset comes with targets, the best number of clusters is already known and it is equal to the number of the persons having their images in the dataset. While finding optimal number of clusters with just the (reduced) features in unsupervised learning setting, the number came out to be 130.\n",
    "4. This number is on the higher side as compared to our intuition for the optimal number of clusters to be equal to the number of people the dataset is having images for.\n",
    "5. Silhouette score was used as a metric to find the best number of clusters. In this approach, a number of models with different k-value (indicating number of clusters) were created and silhouette score for each of these were recorded for analysis. Silhouette score was highest when number of clusters was 130.\n",
    "6. Inertia of all the models were also analyzed and no prominent elbow was observed while plotting inertia against each model with increasing k-value leaving no option to consider any other k-value other than the found one.\n",
    "7. At the end, all images across all found clusters were plotted with their actual labels and it was noticed that\n",
    "    - except for the few, mostly clusters contain images of the same person, and\n",
    "    - number of faces in a clusters varies\n",
    "8. Just clustering the images this way may not be useful directly, but it could save a lot of time when labeling images from just a few labeled images in an semi-supervised learning setting. "
